#### Making a Hot Backup with MySQL Enterprise Backup

#### Making Backups with mysqldump

#### Making Backups by Copying Table Files

#### Making Delimited-Text File Backups

#### Making Backups Using Replication Slaves

#### Recovering Corrupt Tables

If you have to restore MyISAM tables that have become corrupt, try to recover them using `REPAIR TABLE` or [myisamchk -r](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/myisamchk.html) first. That should work in 99.9% of all cases. If [myisamchk](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/myisamchk.html) fails, see [Section 8.6, “MyISAM Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery”](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/myisam-table-maintenance.html).
