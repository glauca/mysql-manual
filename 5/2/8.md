### [5.2.8 Using Options to Set Program Variables](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/program-variables.html)

Suffixes for specifying a value multiplier can be used when setting a variable at server startup, but not to set the value with SET at runtime. On the other hand, with SET, you can assign a variable's value using an expression, which is not true when you set a variable at server startup. For example, the first of the following lines is legal at server startup, but the second is not:

~~~bash
shell> mysql --max_allowed_packet=16M
shell> mysql --max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024
~~~

Conversely, the second of the following lines is legal at runtime, but the first is not:

~~~mysql
mysql> SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16M;
mysql> SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=16*1024*1024;
~~~
