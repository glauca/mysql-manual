#### [5.5.1.3 mysql Logging](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/mysql-logging.html)

Controlling the History File

1. Set the `MYSQL_HISTFILE` environment variable to `/dev/null`. To cause this setting to take effect each time you log in, put it in one of your shell's startup files.
1. Create .mysql_history as a symbolic link to /dev/null; this need be done only once:

~~~bash
shell> ln -s /dev/null $HOME/.mysql_history
~~~
